<h1>Recreation of Cholera Map by Dr. John Snow using D3</h1>
<p>Developed By: Aishwarya Kholkute </p>
<p>Overview:<br> The project uses D3 to recreate the Cholera Map by Dr. John Snow in 1854 that was a breakthrough in identifying the cause of Cholera epidemic in London.</p>
<p>Design Implementation:<br><br>
While designing, the most important goal was ability to derive inferences from the graphics, avoiding overuse of colors, choosing color blind compatible colors.<br>
The charts are arranged in a four-quadrant method instead of one below the other, so as to reduce scrolling from top to bottom of the page.<br>
 The timeline graph and cholera map are placed beside each other since their interconnectivity had to be displayed.<br>
 The other two are supporting charts, hence placed below the main two charts. <br>
 The Cholera Map is placed on right since on the left, the buttons & legends are adjusted and a smaller chart (timeline graph) fit in there perfectly.<br>
 Since the area of Map chart is largest, it maintains the status of focus of webpage.
</p>

<p>Initial Plan:<br>
The structure planned initially was to create a layout as below, however during construction of each element, it became easier to place as per the current setting.</p>

The Design Process:</br>The flow chart indicates the approach.

Interpretation of the results:<br><br>
As indicated in Map, a lot of deaths have happened around one particular pump on broad street.<br>
This indicates the primary source for the Cholera epidemic was the water through that pump. <br>
Minimal deaths around brewery supports the hypothesis that since the workers drank beer, which involved boiled water, thus killing the bacteria responsible making it safe to drink.<br>
The timeline graph indicates the majority of deaths occured in the period 31st August-8September, and the proportion of deaths on either sides of the interval was considerably low.<br>
The deaths by age chart indicates that people older than 80 years are the most affected category followed by young children.<br>
This indicates which age groups are more susceptible to the disease. <br>
The gender graph indicates that men and women are equally affected.
